## Part One

A nice and easy part one; traverse points in the grid within the range of a step target (64) and then count how many you could end on. For an even number of steps you can finish on any even distance. Nothing fancy, just a simple [bfs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)

```ts
export function partOne(input: string[]): number | string {
  const distances = findAccessiblePlots(
    Math.floor(input[0].length / 2),
    Math.floor(input.length / 2),
    input,
    64
  )
  return distances
    .values()
    .filter((x) => x % 2 == 0)
    .toArray().length
}

function findAccessiblePlots(
  startX: number,
  startY: number,
  input: string[],
  stepTarget: number
): Map<string, number> {
  const distances = new Map<string, number>()
  distances.set(startX + ',' + startY, 0)
  const positions = [[startX, startY]]
  const steps = [
    [0, 1],
    [0, -1],
    [1, 0],
    [-1, 0],
  ]

  let pos = 0
  while (positions.length > 0) {
    let current = positions.shift()!
    pos++
    console.log(pos)
    const currentDistance = distances.get(current.join(','))!
    if (currentDistance >= stepTarget) continue

    for (let step of steps) {
      const next = [current[0] + step[0], current[1] + step[1]]
      if (next.some((x) => x < 0 || x >= input.length)) continue

      if (input[next[1]][next[0]] != '#') {
        const nextString = next.join(',')
        const existing = distances.get(nextString)
        if (!existing || existing > currentDistance + 1) {
          distances.set(nextString, currentDistance + 1)
          positions.push(next)
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return distances
}
```

```csharp
public override object PartOne()
{
    var distances = FindAccessiblePlots(Input[0].Length / 2, Input.Length / 2, Input, 64);
    return distances.Values.Count(x => x % 2 == 0);
}

private static Dictionary<string, int> FindAccessiblePlots(int startX, int startY, string[] input, long stepTarget)
{
    Dictionary<string, int> distances = [];
    distances[startX + "," + startY] = 0;
    Queue<(int x, int y)> positions = [];
    positions.Enqueue((startX, startY));
    int[][] steps = [[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]];

    while (positions.Count > 0)
    {
        var (x, y) = positions.Dequeue();
        var currentDistance = distances[x + "," + y];
        if (currentDistance > stepTarget - 1)
            continue;

        foreach (var step in steps)
        {
            var next = (x: x + step[0], y: y + step[1]);
            if (next.x < 0 || next.y < 0 || next.x >= input[0].Length || next.y >= input.Length)
                continue;

            if (input[next.y][next.x] != '#')
            {
                var nextString = next.x + "," + next.y;
                if (!distances.TryGetValue(nextString, out var existing) || existing > currentDistance + 1)
                {
                    distances[nextString] = currentDistance + 1;
                    positions.Enqueue(next);
                }
            }
        }

    return distances;

## Part Two

I feel like 21 is consistently one of the hardest puzzle days of the year, and this is no exception.

<br />
My first thought was simply to naively check the number of accessible points in the
same manner as part 1, albeit with judicious use of the `%` operator to have coords
check the correct areas, without having to actually manually tesselate the input
space. Unsurprisingly, this was faaaar too slow to be useful, so I was forced to
look for other approaches.
<br />
My next idea was to check the distances of all points in the input, and extrapolate
out how many times each of those points (and their tesselated equivalents) could
be reached within the maximum step size. This required a lot of tedious number crunching
based on distances from the start and edge... until I actually looked at the input.
<br />
The input has three very distinct features. Firstly, the start location is precisely
in the center. Secondly, there is a distinct diamond shape that correlates very evenly
with half of the size of the input (ie the points in the diamond shape are equivalent
[manhattan distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) from the start),
and thirdly, there are perfect straight lines of empty space above, below, and to
either side of the start. These three features allow for some shortcuts: we know
the maximum distance we can travel in any direction is exactly equivalent to the
target step count, and therefore the tesselations in any given direction will be
exactly eqiuvalent to `(stepTarget - 0.5*input.Length)/input.Length`. We also know
that the diagonal sections represent the same manhattan distance from the start as
the directly vertical/horizontal edges, so the furthest points we can ever travel
to will be within that diagonal distance - the total area we can travel within is
also shaped like a diamond! Finally, the size of the input space is odd, which, along
with our centered start location, means the odd-distance points in one input-sized
space have even-distances in adjacent tesselations.
<br />
With all of that in mind, we can calculate the accessible points geometrically -
the first input size can be treated as 'odd', the tesselations at cardinal directions
from that are 'even', then 'odd'... and so on. As our number of tesselations in any
cardinal direction are even, the outer most tesselation in those directions will
be odd. Therefore we need to cut off the outside corners of every odd external-edge
tesselation, and also *add* an internal corner from every even external-edge tesselation.
Finally, we can do the actual calculations:

```js
let total =
  (tesselations + 1) ** 2 * oddAccessible +
  tesselations ** 2 * evenAccessible -
  (tesselations + 1) * oddCorners +
  tesselations * evenCorners
```

<br />
Find that hard to follow? I don't blame you!

    input.length

{

    var odd = distances.Values.Count(x => x % 2 == 1);

    var tesselations = (steps - (input.Length / 2)) / input.Length;

    var totalTiles = (Math.Pow(tesselations + 1, 2) * odd) + (Math.Pow(tesselations, 2) * even) - ((tesselations + 1) * oddCorners) + (tesselations * evenCorners);
