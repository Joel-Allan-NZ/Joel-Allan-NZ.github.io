## Part One

Parse the input, build a basic adjacency list, and traverse it according to the given directions until you reach the end point. Alarmingly simple, always a red flag for what you might expect for part 2

<CodeBox names="typescript|C#">

```js
export function partOne(input: string[]): number | string {
  const { directions, graph } = parse(input)
  let steps = 0
  let position = 'AAA'
  let directionIndex = 0

  while (position != 'ZZZ') {
    const direction = directions[directionIndex]
    position =
      direction == 'L' ? graph.get(position)![0] : graph.get(position)![1]
    steps++
    directionIndex =
      directionIndex == directions.length - 1 ? 0 : directionIndex + 1
  }
  return steps
}

function parse(input: string[]): {
  directions: string
  graph: Map<string, string[]>
} {
  const directions = input[0]
  const graph = new Map<string, string[]>()
  input.slice(2).forEach((line) => {
    const paths = [line.slice(7, 10), line.slice(12, 15)]
    graph.set(line.slice(0, 3), paths)
  })
  return { directions, graph }
}
```

```csharp
public override object PartOne()
{
    var (directions, graph) = Parse();
    int steps = 0;
    string position = "AAA";

    while (position != "ZZZ")
    {
        foreach (var direction in directions)
        {
            position = direction == 'L' ? graph[position][0] : graph[position][1];
            steps++;
            if (position == "ZZZ")
                break;
        }
    }
    return steps;
}

private (string directions, Dictionary<string, string[]> graph) Parse()
{
    string directions = Input[0];
    Dictionary<string, string[]> graph = [];
    for (int i = 2; i < Input.Length; i++)
    {
        graph[Input[i][0..3]] = [Input[i][7..10], Input[i][12..15]];
    }
    return (directions, graph);
}
```

## Part Two

Ahhh, here we go.

<br />
First things first, I need to outline a couple assumptions (knowing that this isn't
a real world problem) that I've made in my solution in order to keep it simple:{' '}

- Paths only contain one end. This makes sense based on having as many ends as starts, and my input validates the
  assumption... but it is only an assumption. YMMV

- Longest path loops share a _single_
  GCD. This isn't necessarily true, but the result could be veeeeery big if it isn't.
  True for my input at least.

- Loop lengths have only two meaningful factors: the GCD,
  and a prime number. It makes sense, and holds true for my input.

<br />

With that housekeeping done, I can talk a little about my approach. The idea here
is that each of the A starts will have their own path, looping to a Z point after
a consistent number of steps. So, I find those loop lengths.

<br />
Armed with these lengths, all we need to do is find the smallest number that has
each loop length as a factor. I do this pretty lazily: for the first pair of loops,
I find the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor">GCD</a> via the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">Euclidian</a>
algorithm. As discussed above, I make the assumption that this single GCD will hold
true for all loop lengths, so I simply take the GCD + the other factor for each loop
length. Then I take the product of all of those factors, yielding the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple">LCM</a>, our
answer.

  const factors = new Set<number>()
  const g = gcd(loops[0], loops[1])
